# Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels (extension menu)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can use any image editing software to create these icons. The recommended design is:

- **Background**: LinkedIn blue gradient (#0077b5 to #005885)
- **Icon**: A lightbulb or comment bubble with "AI" text
- **Style**: Clean, modern, professional

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use simple placeholder images or remove the icons section from manifest.json temporarily. The extension will work without icons but won't look as polished.

## AI-Generated Icons

You can also generate icons using AI image generators with prompts like:

- "LinkedIn AI comment assistant icon, lightbulb with speech bubble, blue gradient background, modern flat design"
- "Professional AI assistant icon for LinkedIn, blue color scheme, minimalist design"
